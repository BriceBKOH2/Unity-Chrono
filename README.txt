Javascript file is clockScript.js in Assets directory

TO DO LIST :
- All scripts are unlinked to all object and cant be relinked, apparently unity say the doesnt compile, but did previously and nothing seems wrong code wise, importing the project and updating it to current Unity version caused the problem (also reinstallied unity, maybe its an option problem)

open in Unity to create a .exe file (done in another folder due to build problems that needed a clean folder, issue started after exporting the project to Unity and updating it to current Unity version)
check for bug possibilities => add a bug list to fix (Countdown doesnt start, code seems good, i need to see when and if the update() fonction starts and works), all elements appear correctly on screen
add or change feature, make it easier to add in existing or futur project to have a ready to use clock / timer
